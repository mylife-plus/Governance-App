### Manage  mylife+ DAOs through governance tokens

**The mylife+ governance app contains:**
- A tool for users to manage  mylife+ DAOs through governance tokens
- users vote on proposals with their governance tokens to make changes to the dao. 

1. Connecting mylife+ DAOs to the governance app via https://aragon.org/connect
Aragon Connect is a toolkit for developers to seamlessly integrate DAO functionality into apps. It's easy to use and blazing fast! They deployed on Polygon so operational costs a cheap.
2. User  buy/receive DAO tokens via the [Wallet](https://github.com/mylife-plus/Wallet). 
3. user votes on proposals from the [Bounty App](https://github.com/mylife-plus/Bounty-App) and [Issue App](https://github.com/mylife-plus/Issue-App) with their tokens. 

**Interesting Projects which fits to the idea:**
- Radicle a decentralized code collaboration network https://docs.radicle.xyz/docs/what-is-radicle.html With this repositories can be controlled by DAOs. It's different to github. It's an interesting concept.
- https://aragon.org/ Build your Decentralized Autonomous Organization on open-source infrastructure with governance plugins.
